# Fun Game with Bevy

This is a simple and fun game built using the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/). The game is designed as a weekend project to explore game development and keep things interesting outside of work. I credit most of this to author here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQt-v_bFdao&list=PLVnntJRoP85JHGX7rGDu6LaF3fmDDbqyd

A must watch video series - I enjoyed it thoroughly. Bevy looks awesome!

## Gameplay

- **Player**: You control a blue ball.
- **Objective**: 
    - Hide from enemies (red balls).
    - Collect as many stars as possible to score points.

## Features

- **Single Player Mode**: Navigate the game world, avoid enemies, and collect stars.
- **Enemies**: Red balls that chase the player, adding a layer of challenge.
- **Scoring**: Points are awarded for each star collected.

## Future Plans

- **Multiplayer Mode**: 
    - Introduce a peer-to-peer (P2P) setup.
    - Play against others with two blue balls on a split-screen setup.
- **Enhanced Gameplay**: Additional features and mechanics to make the game more engaging.

## Notes

This project is intended as a fun and casual exploration of game development using Bevy. Contributions and ideas are welcome to make the game even more enjoyable!
